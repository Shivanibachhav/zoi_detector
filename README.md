# zoi_detector
The main objective of this project is to detect zones of inhibition and measure its diameter. This test is used to select effective antibiotic against bacteria. For the detection of zones some preprocessing techniques and hough transform used. After detection of zoi, the diameter is measured and these values are stored in csv file or sql database.
